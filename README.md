# LumEngine
This is a school project consisting in the creation of a rendering engine in C++. 
This engine uses the Vulkan API as well as advanced rendering techniques.This project was done in a group of 3 in 1 month.
I mostly worked on the light management with the implementation of PBR (Physically Based Rendering) among others.
